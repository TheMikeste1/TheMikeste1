# Welcome!
I am a Computer Science student preparing to enter graduate school to earn my master's. I enjoy making my code as fast and secure as possible, and am constantly running experiments to compare different languages, implementations, and algorithms. I have a love for maths and have particularly enjoyed seeing the applications of discrete mathematics in software development.

I have many side projects I am working on at any given point, and enjoy the thrill of learning and developing my skills.

Outside of school, I am currently studying Haskell, malware, and computer security.
